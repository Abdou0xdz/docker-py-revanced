   4. reddit
   5. tiktok
   6. warnwetter
2. If you want to build a specific version . Add `version` in `environment` in the
   format
   ```
   <APPNAME>_VERSION=<VERSION>
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   YOUTUBE_VERSION=17.31.36
   YOUTUBE_MUSIC_VERSION=X.X.X
   TWITTER_VERSION=X.X.X
   REDDIT_VERSION=X.X.X
   TIKTOK_VERSION=X.X.X

   ```
3. If you want to a `latest` version, whatever latest is available(including beta) .
   Add `latest` in `environment` in the format
   ```
   <APPNAME>_VERSION=latest
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   YOUTUBE_VERSION=latest
   YOUTUBE_MUSIC_VERSION=latest
   TWITTER_VERSION=latest
   REDDIT_VERSION=latest
   TIKTOK_VERSION=latest
   WARNWETTER_VERSION=latest
   ```
4. By default, it will build [all](#note) build app supported by Revanced team. If you
   don't
   want to waste time and build only few apps. Add the apps you want to build in
   `environment` in the format
   ```
   PATCH_APPS=<REVANCED_APPS_NAME>
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   PATCH_APPS=youtube,twitter,reddit
   ```
5. If you don't want to use default keystore. You can provide your own by placing it
   inside `apks` folder. And adding the name of `keystore-file` in `environment` like
   ```
    KEYSTORE_FILE_NAME=revanced.keystore
   ```
6. If you want to exclude any patch. Set comma separated patch in `environment` in
   the format
   ```
   EXCLUDE_PATCH_<REVANCED_APPS_NAME>=<PATCH_TO_EXCLUDE-1,PATCH_TO_EXCLUDE-2>
   ```
   Example:
   ```
    EXCLUDE_PATCH_YOUTUBE=custom-branding,hide-get-premium
    EXCLUDE_PATCH_YOUTUBE_MUSIC=yt-music-is-shit
   ```
